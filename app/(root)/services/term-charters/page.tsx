          question: "How much can I earn from chartering my yacht?",
          answer: "Earnings vary based on yacht size, location, season, and demand. Our partner owners typically see 20-40% annual returns on their investment. We'll provide a detailed revenue projection during your initial consultation based on your specific yacht and market."
        },
        {
          question: "Can I still use my yacht for personal trips?",
          answer: "Absolutely! You can reserve your yacht for personal use anytime with advance notice. Many owners use their yacht 2-3 months per year and charter it the rest of the time to offset ownership costs while generating profit."
        },
        {
          question: "What is KOS's commission and fee structure?",
          answer: "Our commission structure is competitive and transparent, typically ranging from 15-30% depending on services included. We provide a detailed breakdown of all fees upfront with no hidden costs. You'll know exactly what you earn from each charter."
        },
        {
          question: "Who is responsible for maintenance and repairs?",
          answer: "We coordinate all routine maintenance between charters to keep your yacht in pristine condition. Major repairs are discussed with you first, and we have preferred vendors offering competitive rates. This actually helps maintain your yacht better than personal use alone."
        },
        {
          question: "What type of insurance is required?",
          answer: "We require comprehensive charter insurance which we can help arrange. This protects both you and your guests, and often costs less than you'd expect. We work with marine insurance specialists to get competitive rates."
