    question: "What do your yachts/boats include?",
    answer: "All of our yacht/boat packages include the vessel, crew, ice and water. Every package is either all in (the price on the site is all inclusive) or plus gratuity (gratuity is additional and is paid to the crew directly). Please make sure to read the description of each."
  },

    question: "Can we take more than 13 people?",
    answer: "For most charters, the Coast Guard only allows a maximum of 13 passengers in your party. There are two ways to have more than 13 people on the water: 1) Get 1 boat with larger capacity - usually a pontoon, catamaran, or large yacht 2) Get 2 vessels and tie them together when safely anchored."

    answer: "Yes, all of our vessels are Coast Guard compliant with all safety equipment and legal documents. Safety is our top priority and we maintain the highest standards."
  },
  {
    question: "Is a captain included?",
    answer: "In accordance with Coast Guard Regulations our team will provide a list of possible crew for your charter prior to onboarding. All our captains are licensed and experienced professionals."
  },
  {
    question: "Can we do a multi-day trip?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We can help find any boat for any budget or time duration! Whether you're looking for a weekend getaway or an extended luxury charter, we have options to suit your needs."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your cancellation policy?",
    answer: "Unsafe conditions (high winds, lightning, pandemic, etc) we will work with your group to reschedule or refund. Unfavorable conditions (cloudy, light rain, etc) most charters will take place. Our team will always work with you!"
  },
  {
    question: "What is the booking process timeline?",
    answer: "We recommend booking at least 2-3 weeks in advance for peak season (holidays and summer months). However, we can often accommodate last-minute bookings subject to availability."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide catering services?",
    answer: "We can arrange catering services through our preferred partners. Options range from casual snacks and beverages to full gourmet dining experiences. Please discuss your preferences with our team during booking."
  },

    question: "What happens in case of bad weather?",
    answer: "Safety is our priority. If weather conditions are deemed unsafe by our captain or Coast Guard, we will work with you to reschedule your charter for another date or provide a full refund as per our weather policy."
