    question: "What is a term charter?",

  {
    question: "What's included in a term charter?",
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: "Do I need boating experience?",
    answer:
      "No experience is necessary as our term charters include professional crew who handle all aspects of vessel operation. You can be as involved or hands-off as you prefer - it's your adventure.",
  },
  {
    question: "What destinations are available?",
    answer:
      "Popular destinations include the Bahamas, Caribbean islands, Florida Keys, and Mediterranean (seasonal). We can customize itineraries based on your interests, time available, and seasonal considerations.",

    question: "How far in advance should I book?",
    answer:
