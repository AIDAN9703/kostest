  {
    question: "How many guests can I have for my special event?",
    answer: "Our fleet can accommodate events of various sizes, from intimate gatherings of 6-8 people to larger events with up to 150 guests. Capacity depends on the vessel selected and the type of event."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I bring my own food and drinks?",
    answer: "Yes, many of our charter options allow you to bring your own refreshments. We also offer catering services and bar packages if you prefer to have everything arranged for you. Our team can discuss the best options for your event."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I decorate the boat for my event?",
    answer: "Yes, tasteful decorations are welcome. Please discuss your decoration plans with us in advance so we can ensure they're compatible with the vessel. We can also arrange professional decoration services for your event."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens in case of bad weather?",
    answer: "We monitor weather conditions closely. If conditions are unsafe, we'll work with you to reschedule your event or provide alternatives. For smaller events, some vessels offer indoor spaces that can still make for a great celebration regardless of weather."
  },
  {
    question: "How far in advance should I book a special event charter?",
    answer: "We recommend booking at least 2-3 months in advance for most events, and 6+ months for larger events like weddings. Popular dates in peak season can book up quickly, so earlier is always better."
